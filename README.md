## Introduction

<div align="center"><img src="assets/img/banner.svg" widtH="100%"></div>

If you want to use the theme just as it is on your own website, you have two options:

- To install this theme as part of a brand-new Jekyll site, you want the [RedEyed Jumpstarter]().
- To add this theme to your existing website, see [this documentation]().

## Installation

Add this line to your Jekyll site's `Gemfile`:

```console
gem "redeyed-jekyll-theme"
```

And add this line to your Jekyll site's `_config.yml`:

```console
theme: redeyed-jekyll-theme
```

And then execute:

```console
$ bundle
```

Or install it yourself as:

```console
$ gem install redeyed-jekyll-theme
```

## ðŸ“š Developer's Quick Start

Before you start, please ensure that you've followed the instructions in the [Jekyll Docs](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) to complete the installation of `Ruby`, `RubyGems`, `Jekyll`, and `Bundler`.  You also need to have the following packages installed:

- Git
- Node.js & npm (I recommend [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) regardless of your platform)

### ðŸ“˜ 1. Fork the Project

The first step you have already hopefully completed before getting to this part of the instructions - you need to fork the project from Github using your favourite tools or the Github website itself.

### ðŸ“˜ 2. Rename & Modify the Gemspec

The next thing you'll want to do is rename the `redeyed-jekyll-theme.gemspec` file to reflect the name of your own project.  Then, open that file and take care of the following details:

- spec.name
- spec.version
- spec.authors
- spec.email
- spec.summary
- spec.homepage
- spec.license
- spec.metadata

### ðŸ“˜ 3. Install standard-version

(Yes, I know it's deprecated - I'll change this as soon as I find a suitable replacement)

Install `standard-version` as a global `bin`:

```console
$ npm i -g standard-version
```

### ðŸ“˜ 4. Install Commitlint & Husky

> If you don't need to do things your own way, Commitlint and Husky can be installed using the script I've included with this package:
> ```console
> $ bash bin/install-commitlint
> ```
> Otherwise, follow each step below and make your changes as necessary

Install `commitlint` & `husky`

```console
$ npm i --save-dev --location=global @commitlint/cli @commitlint/config-conventional husky
```

Configure `commitlint` to use conventional config:

```console
$ echo "module.exports = {extends: ['@commitlint/config-conventional']}" > ..commitlintrc.js
```

And then enable `husky`:

```console
$ husky install
```

Add a husky commit hook:

```shell
cat <<EEE > .husky/commit-msg
#!/usr/bin/env bash
. "\$(dirname "\$0")/_/husky.sh"
npx --no -- commitlint --edit "\${1}"
EEE
```

Make the hook executable:

```console
$ chmod a+x .husky/commit-msg
```

Make sure you check out the [Contributor's Guide - Appendices](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#appendix-a-commitlint-commit-types) for tips on how to use commitlint, why it's useful, and examples of how to structure your own commit messages to make the best use of the package.

### ðŸ“˜ 5. Install Dependencies

Install Jekyll dependencies:

```console
$ bundle install
```

### ðŸ“˜ 6. Start Local Server

Then, start your local server in watch mode:

```console
$ bundle exex jekyll serve --watch
```

Now, open your browser to http://localhost:4000 and make your changes

When your theme is released, only the files in `_layouts`, `_includes`, `_sass` and `assets` tracked with Git will be bundled.
To add a custom directory to your theme-gem, please edit the regexp in `redeyed-jekyll-theme.gemspec` accordingly.

The theme is available as open source under the terms of the [MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).
